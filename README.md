# PLAN

### => Process
- Two terminals used:
	- Chat  Terminal
	- Input Terminal
- Those terminals send data through file inside /.var/a_c folder


### => Features
- Basic AI Chatting		: send messages, AI can response to that.
- Notifications 		: sounds of new chat, sending chat, etc (idk what else)
- Typing Indicator		: We can't see the text generated from AI but, it should wait until the AI complete and only then it send the message. It also has typing indicator if it currently generating the text
- Chat Fredom 			: doesn't need user to chat first for the AI to talk
- User First			: if the AI is currently typing but user sends a message, the AI will delete their thoughts and sends a message that accords to the user
- Mood 					: relative to the choosen character
- Online Hours			: online just at specific hours but, when the user type message, it'll go online instantly or for several minutes relative to the mood
- Scallable Memory 		: memory optimization (probably last for 2 days or so (i hope it can last 1629510 years or around (or even more (pls))))
- Voice Notes (?)		: the AI can sends a voice message
- Image (?)				: user or the AI can sends an image
